# MicroExchange

**Exchange-grade CLOB matching engine + ITCH-style market data replay + microstructure analytics in modern C++20.**

### 3D Order Book Surface — Depth × Price × Time
Bid side (blue) and ask side (red) form the characteristic valley around the midpoint. Depth clusters at key levels and shifts with the price drift.

![Order Book 3D](docs/images/orderbook_3d.png)

### 3D Price Impact Surface — Kyle's λ Landscape
Price impact as a function of trade volume and order flow imbalance. The concave shape demonstrates the square-root law of impact (Bouchaud et al., 2018) — larger trades have diminishing marginal impact, amplified by directional imbalance.

![Impact 3D](docs/images/impact_3d.png)

### Spread Decomposition — Huang-Stoll (1997)
Effective spread decomposed into realized spread (market maker revenue) and price impact (adverse selection). The adverse selection component dominates at ~68%.

![Spread Decomposition](docs/images/spread_decomposition.png)

### Stylized Facts: Fat Tails & Volatility Clustering
Left: return distribution vs Gaussian — heavy tails from Hawkes-driven clustering. Right: autocorrelation of |returns| showing slow decay characteristic of ARCH effects.

## Microstructure Concepts Implemented

| Domain | Concept | Implementation |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Market Structure** | Price-time priority (FIFO) | `core/OrderBook` with deterministic sequencing |
| **Market Structure** | Queue position tracking | Per-level FIFO queues with sequence numbers |
| **Liquidity** | Quoted spread | Real-time BBO tracking in `analytics/SpreadAnalyzer` |
| **Liquidity** | Effective spread | Trade-midpoint deviation analysis |
| **Liquidity** | Depth & resilience | Post-trade book recovery metrics |
| **Price Formation** | Realized spread | 5-second post-trade midpoint reversion |
| **Price Formation** | Price impact (permanent) | Effective − Realized spread decomposition |
| **Information** | Order flow imbalance (OFI) | Signed volume aggregation → return prediction |
| **Information** | Kyle's λ | Regression: ΔP = λ · signed_volume + ε |
| **Adverse Selection** | Glosten-Milgrom intuition | Spread widens with information asymmetry in simulation |
| **Inventory** | Ho-Stoll / Avellaneda-Stoikov | Quote skewing under inventory risk in MM agent |
| **Stylized Facts** | Fat tails, vol clustering | Hawkes arrival process + empirical verification |
| **Stylized Facts** | Spread under stress | Endogenous widening with order imbalance |

## What Makes This Different

Most GitHub "matching engines" are toy implementations — a sorted map, a match loop, and a README. This project bridges **three disciplines**:

1. **Systems engineering** — Lock-free queues, arena allocation, cache-aligned structures, deterministic replay, property-based invariant testing
2. **Financial economics** — Spread decomposition, adverse selection models, information-based trading theory (Glosten-Milgrom, Kyle, Ho-Stoll)
3. **Quantitative research** — Reproducible empirical analysis, stylized fact generation, microstructure model calibration

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Volatility clustering is weak**: The AC(|r|) at lag 1 is ~0.02, well below the empirical 0.15-0.40 range. The Hawkes process generates clustered *arrivals* but the ZI agents don't modulate aggressiveness with volatility. A regime-switching model or agents that condition on recent returns would help.

- **Kyle's lambda R² is near zero**: The midprice indexing uses event count rather than wall clock time, so the interval bucketing doesn't align properly. Needs timestamp-based aggregation.

- **FeedPublisher overwrites OrderBook callbacks**: The `attach()` method calls `book.set_trade_callback()` which clobbers the engine's internal routing. Needs a multi-subscriber pattern (vector of callbacks, or an event bus). Disabled in main.cpp for now.

- **Arena allocator never frees**: Orders accumulate in the arena for the lifetime of the process. Fine for simulation (it exits) but would need periodic cleanup or epoch-based reclamation for production.

- **No proper order tracking per agent**: The cancellation logic in the simulator is approximate — agents don't track their own outstanding orders, so cancel rates are estimates.

## Build

Requires C++20 and CMake 3.20+.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

Or without CMake:
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -I core/include -I md/include -I sim/include -I analytics/include \
    src/main.cpp -o build/micro_exchange
```

### Run Simulation
```bash
# Generate 1M orders via Hawkes process, match, and compute analytics
./bin/micro_exchange --mode simulate --orders 1000000 --symbol AAPL

# Replay ITCH-format historical data
./bin/micro_exchange --mode replay --file data/sample_itch.bin

# Run full analytics pipeline
./bin/micro_exchange --mode analyze --input results/trades.csv
```

### Run Tests & Benchmarks
```bash
./bin/test_matching_engine      # Property-based invariant tests
./bin/test_fuzz_orders          # Fuzz random order sequences
./bin/bench_throughput           # Single-thread matching throughput
./bin/bench_latency              # Latency histogram (p50/p95/p99/p999)
```

---

## Sample Results

P99.9 latency:  1,371 ns
```

### Spread Decomposition (1hr simulated AAPL)

590K orders → 210K trades

Metric                  Value (ticks)
─────────────────────────────────────
Quoted spread           1.06
Effective spread        2.51
Realized spread         1.73
Price impact            0.56
Adverse selection %     22.3%
```

### Stylized Facts
```
Excess kurtosis:    78.5  (benchmark: > 0)     ✓
AC(|r|, lag=1):     0.02  (benchmark: 0.15+)   ✗ (see Known Issues)
AC(|r|, lag=10):    0.03  (benchmark: > 0)      ✓
```

## Design Decisions

- **Intrusive doubly-linked list for price levels** — O(1) insert/remove at known position; avoids `std::map` overhead and heap fragmentation
- **Arena allocator for Order objects** — Pre-allocated slab; zero malloc on the hot path; deterministic deallocation
- **SPSC lock-free ring buffer for MD feed** — Single-producer/single-consumer between matching thread and feed handler; no mutex contention
- **Compile-time order type dispatch** — `if constexpr` eliminates branch misprediction for known order types
- **Contiguous price level array** — Cache-friendly iteration for BBO updates and book snapshots
- **Sequence numbers on every event** — Enables deterministic replay, gap detection, and recovery

---

## Validation & Correctness

| Test Category | What It Verifies |
|---|---|
| **Invariant: No crossed book** | After every match cycle, best bid < best ask |
| **Invariant: FIFO preserved** | Orders at same price fill in arrival order |
| **Invariant: Deterministic** | Same input stream → identical output on every run |
| **Fuzz: Random sequences** | 10M random order events with invariant checks |
| **Replay consistency** | Reconstructed book from incremental feed matches snapshot |
| **Metric cross-check** | Effective spread = quoted spread (for market orders at BBO) |
| **Conservation** | Total filled quantity = sum of both sides of every trade |
